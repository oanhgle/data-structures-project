## Data Structures Projects 
- Project 1: Developed a code to draw Hilbert curves which is a line that covers a 2D plane arbitrarily well.
- Project 2: Implemented a variant of an AVL tree called a countdown tree that keeps track of its height and works to ensure that the height of the left and right subtrees differ by at most 1 for every node in the tree. 
- Project 3: Develop a class capable of calculating the strongly connected components of a directed graph.
